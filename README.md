# 👋 Hi there, my name's KV Le

## 👨🏻‍💻 About me:
I am a constant wanderer when it comes to learning new things. I strive to dive deep into the topics I get into, often obsessing over things weeks at a time. Unfortunately, this means I often switch around after I burnout 😅 I usually come back though 👍 I really do love learning about new things, especially if they promise to be a new way of thinking about things.

I also like to play tennis 🎾, play video games 🎮, and listen to good long form podcasts 🎙. Some of my favorite video games are: osu!, CS:GO, Age of Empires II, Risk of Rain 2, and Minecraft. I also enjoy listening to the [Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/), [Philosophize This](https://www.philosophizethis.org/), and [Huberman Lab](https://hubermanlab.com/) Podcasts.

Finally, if you've read through this page and seen my commit messages, you'll know that emojis are supreme 💯
